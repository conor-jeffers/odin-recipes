    <p>Fancy some time off work? Just follow this cartoonish set of instructions to net yourself some well earned time out of the office!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A lovely, ripe banana</li>
        <li>Access to a flight of stairs (preferrably in work)</li>
        <li>A high pain tolerance</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First off, peel and eat your big, sweaty banana.</li>
        <li>Throw it on the ground, right at the top of a big ol' flight of stairs.</li>
        <li>Leave the scene briefly, and then reappear as if to head down the stairs, watching your feet as you go.</li>
        <li>If you watched your feet well enough, you hsould have been able to land a step on the banana peel, which should have now sent you flying down the flight of stairs.</li>
        <li>Wait for someone to call an ambulane, and consider your job done!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This might suck to pull off, but done right, it can easily get you a few weeks off work. Have fun!</p>
