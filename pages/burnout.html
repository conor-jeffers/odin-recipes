    <p>Here's another one to get you some time off work. Be careful, you need to have a pretty tough mind to do this <em>without</em> going insane.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A tough mind, for starters.</li>
        <li>Enough freedom to do lots of extra work for your company.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Firstly, just go all in at work. Become the ultimate brown noser - the opposite of the quiet quitter.</li>
        <li>Keep at this for as long as possible, at least for a months.</li>
        <li>When you finally feel that you're about to die, go and see your doctor about how worn out you feel. If all goes to plan, they <em>should</em> sign you off of work.</li>
        <li>Call your boss and let them know the good news, yay!</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Warning:</strong> this one might well fuck you up. Only attempt this if you really know you can pull through to the other side. And hey, if you make it, you can always extend that time off work by playing the "mental health" card!</p>
